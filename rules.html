        <p>
          <span class="bold">Arena</span> is Minecraft area where multiples
          entities fight against one unique BOSS. This area represent a chuck of
          32 blocks by 32 blocks in Minecraft world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every 10 minutes a new BOSS spawn at the center of the
          <span>Arena</span> and start fighting against entities present inside
          the area. The BOSS can only focus one entity by one and can not fight
          multiples entities together.
        </p>
        <p>
          To win the <span class="bold">Arena</span>, you need to defeat the
          BOSS by placing new entities within this area. The
          <span class="bold">Arena</span> is open during 10 minutes. During this
          time, you can create, modify, or delete any entity you want. After 10
          minutes, the <span class="bold">Arena</span> close, a new BOSS spawn
          and start fighting against all entities inside the area.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can not create, modify or delete any entities while the
          <span>Arena</span> is closed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <span class="bold">Arena</span> stop fight and re-open when all
          entities died inside area or BOSS is defeated.
